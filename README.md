# 👋 Hi, I'm Muhammad Aizaz

I'm a **Full Stack Developer** passionate about building scalable, efficient, and modern web applications. With expertise in both frontend and backend technologies, I create seamless user experiences and robust backend solutions. 🚀

## 💻 Technologies & Tools

### Frontend
- **React.js & Next.js**  
  I specialize in building fast, responsive web applications using **React.js** and **Next.js**. These frameworks help me create dynamic, SEO-friendly websites that deliver smooth, interactive user experiences.

- **TypeScript**  
  I use **TypeScript** to make my code safer and easier to maintain, ensuring better collaboration and fewer bugs in large-scale applications.

- **State Management**  
  Managing state in complex applications with tools like **Redux** and **React Context** to ensure seamless data flow and consistency across components.

- **Web Performance Optimization**  
  I focus on making websites fast, using techniques like lazy loading and code splitting to improve load times and the overall user experience.

- **Testing & Debugging**  
  I ensure my code is reliable by writing tests using tools like **Jest** and **Cypress**. This helps catch bugs early and ensures everything works as expected.

### Backend
- **Python** | **FastAPI**  
  I build fast, high-performance APIs using **Python** with **FastAPI**. FastAPI offers automatic interactive API documentation and is known for its speed and support for asynchronous operations, perfect for building scalable backends.

- **Node.js** | **Express.js**  
  Building robust, scalable RESTful APIs with **Node.js** and **Express.js**. I create server-side applications with **JavaScript** or **TypeScript**, ensuring high scalability and modularity in the backend code.

- **GraphQL APIs**  
  I implement **GraphQL APIs** for more flexible and powerful querying, providing clients with only the data they need while reducing the number of requests.

- **SQL Databases** (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)  
  Experienced in building and managing relational databases like **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, and **SQLite**. I design and optimize schemas, write efficient SQL queries, and ensure data integrity through relational models.

- **NoSQL Databases** (MongoDB, Firebase)  
  Familiar with working with **MongoDB** and **Firebase**, using them for scalable, schema-less data storage when high availability and fast access are crucial.


### DevOps & Cloud
- **GitHub Actions & Workflows**  
  Automating deployment, testing, and CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions for continuous integration and delivery.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**  
  Streamlining development processes and ensuring fast, reliable releases with automated CI/CD pipelines.
- **AWS Services like EC2, Lambdas, S3, API Gateway, Step Functions, etc**  
  Harnessing the power of AWS for serverless applications, scalable cloud services, and infrastructure management.
